          <h2>Luskin Institute and Democracy at UCLA published a new report in July titled "Hotel California: Housing the Crisis" urging Los Angeles to aquire vacant hotels and motels and convert them into permanent housing for the city's 60,000
            unhoused residents.
          </h2>

          <h3>By aquiring empty hotel and motel units, LA can also create housing for the thousands on the verge of eviciton, the study says. </h3>

          <p> “It is time to redirect public resources and public purpose tools such as eminent domain for low-income and extremely low-income housing, especially in Black and brown communities where public investment has primarily taken the form of
            policing,” says Gary Blasi, UCLA professor emeritus of Law and co-author of the report. </p>

          <p> The report details the six ZIP codes most at-risk for eviction when moratoriums end on Jan 1 2021. These ZIP codes are also predominatley Black and
            brown. Without public intervention, houselessness will increase the already disproportionate numbers for these communities. While LA allocates $500 million, Jane Nguyen, Co-Founder of Ktown for All, says $80 million of that fund goes to
            LAPD. Echoing Blasi's observations that the city has largely invests in the criminalization of poverty, instead of housing. </p>

          <p> "It's a matter of priority," says the housing advocate. "Los Angels city council just voted to resume CDC defying sweeps. Even in a pandemic the city is terrorizing our unhoused neighbors and potentially spreading the virus while doing
            it." The $80
            million dollars could be converterd into more than 1,000 units of housing at the average cost of about $80,000 per unit. In sum, the study asserts the solution to houselessness in Los Angeles is publically aquired, permanant housing. As
            outlined in the map below, the reaollocation of LAPD funds would cover half then necessary housing neede to
            prevent the
            pending increase of houselessness in these six at-risk zip codes. The reallocation would not disturb the LAPD general budget, which is set at more than $3 billion for 2020-2021. </p>
